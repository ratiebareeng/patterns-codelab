* Records are comma-delimited field lists enclosed in parentheses.
* Record fields can each have a different type, so records can collect multiple types.
* Records can contain both named and positional fields, like argument lists in a function.
* Records can be returned from a function, so they enable you to return multiple values from a function call.
